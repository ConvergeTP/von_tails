Operation
******************************

This section discusses the operation of the tails file server and synchronization scripts.

Tails Server
==============================

This section outlines the startup and shutdown of the tails server.

Stop and Start
------------------------------

To stop and start the tails file server in the foreground, the operator changes to the ``von_tails`` installation directory and issues

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd docker
    $ ./manage stop
    $ ./manage start

at the prompt. The execution occupies the terminal window; the tails file server is ready when the operation outputs a record noting that Sanic is "Goin' Fast" on the configured port.

The startup process always begins from scratch on ``manage start``, removing any extant containers from prior operations.

To start the tails file server in the background, the operator may issue 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./manage bg

instead, which starts the tails file server (or resumes operation from any existing containers) in the shell's background.

The operator may follow the tails file server container's docker logs via

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker logs -f <docker_von_tails_1>

where ``<docker_von_tails_1>`` represents the agent container (not image) of interest.

Container Shutdown and Removal
------------------------------

To stop the tails server container, the operator changes to the ``von_tails`` installation directory and issues

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd docker
    $ ./manage stop

at the prompt. Alternatively, if the docker containers are operating in the terminal's foreground, the operator may simply issue control-C and wait for graceful shutdown.

To stop and remove all containers, the operator may issue

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./manage rm

at the prompt.

Synchronization Scripts
------------------------------

Script ``src/sync.py`` performs one iteration of the synchronization process. An operator may call this script for a one-time manual synchronization operation. Its command line arguments represent:

- the topmost tails directory for the VON anchor
- the tails server hostname or IP address
- the tails server port
- the synchronization role:

  - ``issuer`` to upload local-only tails files from within the tails directory to the server
  - ``prover`` to download remote-only tails files from the server to the tails directory.

Script ``src/multisync.py`` performs several iterations of the synchronization process, spaced evenly over a single minute: the number of such iterations appears as the first parameter, preceding those that it passes to the src/sync.py script.

A new iteration of the synchronization process only starts if one is not already running â€“ typical operation will not overlap iterations.

This script's intended use is integration via cron, as per :ref:`integrate_cron`.


.. _sync-config:

Configuration
........................

These scripts take a ``.ini``-style configuration file with the following content:

* section ``[Tails Server]``, specifying:

    * ``host``: the hostname or address of the tails server
    * ``port``: the port on which the tails server listens

* section ``[Tails Client]``, specifying:

    * ``profile``: ``issuer`` to upload or ``prover`` to download
    * ``tails.dir``: the location of the top of the tails directory on the client host

* (for issuers only) section ``[Node Pool]``, specifying:
    * ``name``: the name of the node pool
    * ``genesis.txn.path``: the path to the file with the node pool's genesis transactions

* (for issuers only) section ``[VON Anchor]``, specifying:
    * ``seed``: the seed for the (issuer) VON anchor
    * ``wallet.name``: the name of the wallet
    * ``wallet.type``: the wallet type (defaults to indy-sdk default)
    * ``wallet.key``: the value of the wallet access (password) credentials (defaults to VON anchor default).

Administrative Deletion Script
------------------------------

In the case where an audit reveals suspect content, an administrative deletion script ``src/admin/delete.py`` provides a means to delete such via the RESTful API. The script takes a configuration file and an identifier to match tails file content by revocation registry identifier; one of:

* ``all``: matching everything, or
* an issuer DID: matching all tails file content that the VON anchor having the issuer DID produced, or
* a credential definition identifier: matching tails file content from revocation registries corresponding to the indicated credential definition, or
* a revocation registry identifier: matching one tails file content for the single indicated revocation registry.

Configuration
........................

The script takes a ``.ini``-style configuration file with the following content:

* section ``[Tails Server]``, specifying:

    * ``host``: the hostname or address of the tails server
    * ``port``: the port on which the tails server listens

* section ``[Node Pool]``, specifying:
    * ``name``: the name of the node pool
    * ``genesis.txn.path``: the path to the file with the node pool's genesis transactions

* section ``[VON Anchor]``, specifying:
    * ``seed``: the seed for the tails server VON anchor
    * ``wallet.name``: the name of the wallet
    * ``wallet.type``: the wallet type (defaults to indy-sdk default)
    * ``wallet.key``: the value of the wallet access (password) credentials (defaults to VON anchor default).
